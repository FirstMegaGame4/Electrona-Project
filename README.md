## About
Electrona is my first Tech mod. It first began when I wanted to make a mod with energy, solar panels, batteries, ... <br />
Then I expanded it, making more and more generators and machines, more useful items and armors. <br />
I also wanted to make cleaner GUIs that are more representative of what Electrona is about: a clean mod. <br />

## Compatibility
Electrona can work with Machineria, a mod by Hidan. <br />
The EL Converter can convert ELs into VPs and into FE (Forge Energies) <br />
Electrona also work with Patchouli Books. The Electronic Tablet gives you many informations about blocks, machines and custom recipes. <br />
WARNING : Patchouli Books have been dropped since r1.2 version, so use the website instead. <br />

## Special Thanks
People who helped me making this mod are below the description, but I wanted to make special thanks to :
- Aixiis (alias super_cube4) for helping design the first GUIs that defined and still define Electrona.
- birb for helping designing things for this mod and being a good texturer.
- Fredzik22 (alias Fredzik) who is also a good texturer of the mod.
