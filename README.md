## About
Electrona is my first Tech mod. I really wanted to code by myself for the first time.
I also wanted to make cleaner GUIs that are more representative of what Electrona is about.

## Special Thanks
People who helped me making this mod are below the description, but I wanted to make special thanks to :
- Aixiis (alias super_cube4) for helping design the first GUIs that defined and still define Electrona.
- BananOgato (alias Darklaime) for helping designing things for this mod and being a good texturer.
- Fredzik22 (alias Fredzik) who is also a good texturer of the mod.

## Required mods
Electrona can work with Machineria, a mod by Hidan. The EL Converter can convert ELs into VPs and into FE (Forge Energies)
Electrona also work with Patchouli Books. The Electronic Tablet gives you many informations about blocks, machines and custom recipes.
And last, for any mod, I advice you to use JEI (Just Enough Items) for the crafts. You can also use JER (Just Enough Ressources) if you want.

## What's next?
There is still a lot of stuff I'm planning to add to Electrona.
- Major update in 1.16.4 is coming, adding a lot of stuff and fixing some bugs.
- A minor update will be following, named "Sounds and Lights update"!
